# Happy-Fathers-Day
To My Father, Who loves trains and never hesitated to say "I love you." Thank you for the stories, lessons, and moments spent listening to the tracks beneath us as we waved to Opa. Your honor, strength, and love have shaped me in ways Iâ€™ll always cherish.  Happy Fatherâ€™s Day! ğŸš‚ğŸ’™
